// The memory is a game where you have turned-over cards in front of you and you must find pairs.
// You can return two cards at a time, if they are the same, they stay visible, if not, they go back to being flipped over.
//
// Instead of cards, we will be using emojis and you can start with these:
//
// const cards = ["🐰", "🐰", "🎃", "🎃", "🌲","🌲"];
//
// For this progran, you will need to install packages in the exercise directory. You do that with the command npm install.
// It will allow you to use the clear() function that will clear your terminal (you need to show only the cards you found).
//


// This function will clear the terminal when called
const clear = require("cli-clear");


const cards = ["🐰", "🐰", "🎃", "🎃", "🌲","🌲"];
